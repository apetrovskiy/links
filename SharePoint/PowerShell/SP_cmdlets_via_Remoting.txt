At first look, this seems workable:
New-SPSite ... -OwnerAlias "administrator"
In fact, after this line being run, the owner might be a local account (in case a local account has the same name as its domain counterpart):
(Get-SPSite -Identity http://...site...coll..).Owner.UserLogin
Here is shown the local account, right?
